# Intro

Let's start a color analysis **inside your own project**. You just need to install this package globally and run it on your project. Simple like that.

## Getting Started

Get started by **installing this package**.

```bash
npm i -g color-doctor
```

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
  - Consider install NVM to easily switch between Node.js versions;

## Execute a single command inside your project

We can start with the easy way to **generate a color report**.

You just need to be on your project root and run the command:

```bash
color-doctor find-colors
```

If everything ok, you'll get a `report.html` inside your project root folder.
